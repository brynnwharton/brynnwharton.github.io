## Our Project

Our project was designed with COVID-19 in mind.  We ask users to input their daily activities so that they are
able to easily track where they've been and share this with their friends or family.  While designed with COVID-19 in mind, this service might work well for dementia patients or other users with frequent memory loss.

### Features

Our features include

- Live map of the US to track COVID-19 cases
- An activity feed to show all users recent activity
- Log in capabilities to enter your own activity
- Personalized activity feed to show where you've recently been
